                The Echoes Kitchen opened in March 2019 as a Mediterranean club
                restaurant in Prenzlauer Berg, Berlin and later moved to Mitte.
                It is relatively small and comfortable, can host up to 40 guests
                during winter and almost double of that during summer due to the
                huge terrace. The price range is from medium to high. The
                concept of the restaurant is “Fine Casual Dining”, which is
                based on the following values: * high level of service and
                exceptional hospitality * * top quality products and exclusive
                creative dishes * * unique modern interior design that make a
                visit special * * is thought as a place for returning customers
                that feel at home * At MontRaw guests can spend quality time,
                perhaps with a glass of wine with colleagues, relatives and
                friends. MontRaw is open, friendly, lively.
